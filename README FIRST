LinkRoulette is a game where you can generate links from url shortners to view via a webbrowser, it's more akin to ruollete as you may not get what you expected!
as links could link anywhere please take caution as although the majority of the randomly generated links are benign or dead, however there may be some 
potentially Malicious or deceptive sites(eg phishing or fake sites with malicious software hosted) which have had their URL'S 
shortened using these url shortening services so USE AT YOUR OWN RISK as you are liable for any damage caused to your own computer from using this program,
either from running the code which is provided as-is,or from the content of the webpages opened/loaded/acessed by using/connecting to the randomly generated links which are opened in your browser
as the owners of the websites are responsible for what happens to your computer when you connect and any software you may download or is saved by the sites.

by using this software or connecting to these sites YOU are responsible for any effect it has on the computer it is running on!
also due to the nature of shortened links they are liable to change where they point to, so the same shortened link may after a given time or under certain circumstances may resolve to a different URL than last time it was acessed

So USE AT YOUR OWN RISK and have fun :D
